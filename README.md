Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio!
This repository showcases a collection of projects that highlight my skills in SQL, R, Excel, and Tableau. Each project demonstrates my ability to perform exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, dashboard creation,
and clear communication of insights.

A bit about me: I earned my B.S. in Economics (minor in Political Science) from West Virginia University and went on to complete my M.A. in Economics at Howard University. I am a researcher, entrepreneur, and 
creative with a strong curiosity for solving problems through data.

Professionally, I have 1 year of experience as a Deals Strategy Associate at PwC Strategy&, where I supported private equity and corporate clients with commercial due diligence and growth strategy projects. In this 
role, I conducted market research, evaluated company performance, and built financial and operational models to inform investment decisions. Most importantly, I translated these findings into actionable insights and
client-ready deliverables.

At PwC, I strengthened my technical skills in SQL, Excel, PowerPoint, and Tableau, developing dashboards, reports, and presentations used directly by clients. I also collaborated closely with team members and 
stakeholders to ensure clear, data-driven decision-making.
